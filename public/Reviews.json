It has everything you need to get you up to speed and more!!! Apart from innovative challenges and awesome projects, what I personally really admired was the fact that Jonas really took a lot of effort in explaining 'How JS works under the hood' and that is the most precious thing in this course, and just what I wanted."

The pace is great and he brings in examples that help to understand it even further. Having some prior knowledge in blockchain and crypto already, I feel that George brought more clarity to things that I thought I had already known. Nice refresher!"

Only one person in the class really had a handle on things, and most people didn't do very well with his assignments. Some even had to learn outside of class in order to understand. I think I've already learned more in 3 little 5 minute videos just presenting the material than I understood in his jargon-riddled syllabus. Thank you!"
